Fritz is the fifth top-10 men's seed to be knocked out of the French Open in the opening week. Former world number two Alexander Zverev outlasted American 12th seed Frances Tiafoe 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 7-6 (7-5) to reach the fourth round. The German, seeded 22nd, is making his return to Grand Slam tennis after tearing multiple ligaments in his right ankle during last year's Roland Garros semi-final against Rafael Nadal. There was a contentious moment in the second-set tie-break when umpire Arnaud Gabbas refused to come down from the chair to check a line call after Tiafoe questioned a call of "out". The call give Zverev set point, which he promptly took before going on to win the next two sets and set up a fourth-round meeting with Grigor Dimitrov. Norway's Ruud, meanwhile, will next face Nicolas Jarry after the Chilean beat American Marcos Giron 6-2 6-2 6-7 (7-9) 6-3. Argentina's Tomas Martin Etcheverry reached the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time with a 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 over Croatian 15th seed Borna Coric, while Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka ended qualifier Thiago Seyboth Wild's run. Brazil's Seyboth Wild knocked out second seed Daniil Medvedev in the first round but he could not stop Nishioka fighting back to win 3-6 7-6 (10-8) 2-6 6-4 6-0.
